# Feature Specifications

This directory contains spec-driven development artifacts for features in this project.

## Structure

Each feature has its own subdirectory with three documents:

- **requirements.md** - User stories and acceptance criteria using EARS patterns
- **design.md** - Architecture, components, and correctness properties
- **tasks.md** - Implementation checklist with numbered tasks

## Workflow

1. **Requirements** - Define what the feature should do
2. **Design** - Plan how it will work and what properties must hold
3. **Tasks** - Break down implementation into actionable steps
4. **Execute** - Implement tasks one at a time

## Creating a New Spec

To start a new feature spec, just tell the agent what you want to build. The agent will guide you through requirements, design, and task planning before any code is written.

## Example Features

Features might include:
- New model integration capabilities
- Performance optimizations
- API enhancements
- Testing infrastructure improvements
