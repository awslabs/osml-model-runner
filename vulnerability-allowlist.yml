  # For kernel headers, please review https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#linux-kernel-capabilities
  CVE-2023-2156: | # High: RPL protocol handling leading to denial of service conditon.
    Kernel Header - Only works on IPv6. We are not using IPv5 and network management is handled by infrastructure
    around the container. 
  CVE-2023-2236: |  # High: use-after-free io_install_fixed_file leading to local privilege escaltion.
    Kernel Header - Hardware management is handled by the infrastructure around the container.
  CVE-2023-31436: | # High: QoS can rigger an incorrect MTU value leading to privilege escalation.
    Kernel Header - Network management is handled by the infrastructure around the container. 
  CVE-2023-3609: | # High: Network Scheduler could allow an attacker to local privilege escalation
    Kernel Header - Network management is handled by the infrastructure around the container. 
  CVE-2023-3812: | # High: Linux TUN/TAP device driver escalate privileges
    Kernel Header - Hardware management is handled by infrastructure outside the container.
  CVE-2023-39191: | # High: User-supplied eBPF programs may allow an attacker with CAP_BPF privileges to escalate privileges
    Kernel Header - These containers do not contain user-supplied eBPF programs, and 
    Docker does not allow CAP_BPF capabilities (https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/oci/caps/defaults.go#L6-L19)
  CVE-2023-4128: | # High: Use-after-free on net/sched/cls_fw.c leading to local privilege escalation.
    Kernel Header -  Network management is handled by the infrastructure around the container.
  CVE-2023-5178: | # High: Use after free vulnerability in nvme target drivers.
    Kernel Header - We are not using NVMe to TCP protocols to controllers. Hardware management is also
    handled outside of a container.
  CVE-2023-5345: | # High: Flaw in  SMB client component in Linux kernel.
    Kernel Header - Network management is handled by the infrastructure around the container, 
    SMB Client isn't utilized in container to begin with and won't affect the system.
  CVE-2023-5633:  |  # High: Use-after-free flaw with VMWare
    This flaw is only exposed when running inside a VMWare guest with 3D
    acceleration enabled which could allow an escalation of privileges. 
    This container is not running inside VMWare and is not using 3D
    acceleration.
  CVE-2023-42753: | # High: User with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can escalate privileges
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability is not activated in this container so exploit cannot occur.
